## Client-Server Overview

As we continue on our DevOps journey, we will come across and employ principles that are not just relevant to us but to others in their varied areas. 
One such example is the client-server architecture. 
More people than ever before use and rely on computers and the networks to which they are connected for a variety of functions, putting a significant demand on servers and networks. 
As if these difficulties weren't enough, DevOps Engineer must also cope with a steady trickle of new technologies that must be integrated into the network. 
In this fast-paced environment, evolving is crucial for keeping a business current and competitive.
To withstand the pressure of evolving in this fast-paced environment, client-server architecture is built. 
It refers to a network-connected architecture in which two or more computers transmit and receive requests from one another.
Let us break it down further.
* Client: In the DevOps world this is refered to as a computer or device also known as `Host`. Client computers provide an interface to allow a computer user to request services of the server and to display the results the server returns

Where as a server is a remote computer that wait for requests to arrive from clients and then respond to them. Ideally, a server provides a standardized transparent interface to clients so that clients need not be aware of the specifics of the system (i.e., the hardware and software) that is providing the service.
