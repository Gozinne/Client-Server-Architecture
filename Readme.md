## Client-Server Overview

As we continue on our DevOps journey, we will come across and employ principles that are not just relevant to us but to others in their varied areas. 
One such example is the client-server architecture. 
More people than ever before use and rely on computers and the networks to which they are connected for a variety of functions, putting a significant demand on servers and networks. 
As if these difficulties weren't enough, DevOps Engineer must also cope with a steady trickle of new technologies that must be integrated into the network. 
In this fast-paced environment, evolving is crucial for keeping a business current and competitive.
To withstand the pressure of evolving in this fast-paced environment, client-server architecture is built. 
It refers to a network-connected architecture in which two or more computers transmit and receive requests from one another.
Let us break it down further.
* Client: In the DevOps world this is refered to as a computer or device also known as `Host`. Client computers provide an interface to allow a computer user to request services of the server and to display the results the server returns
* Server: A server, on the other hand, is a remote computer that waits for client requests before responding to them. A server should ideally provide a standardised transparent interface to clients so that they are unaware of the characteristics of the system (i.e., the hardware and software) that is providing the service.

This computing strategy works well when clients and servers have distinct tasks to complete on a regular basis. 
In hospital data processing, for example, a client computer may run application software to enter patient information, while the server computer runs another program to administer the database where the information is stored indefinitely. 
Many clients can access the server's information at the same time, and a client computer can perform other tasks, such as sending e-mail. 
The client-server technique varies significantly from the conventional "mainframe" design, in which a centrally located mainframe computer conducted all tasks for its associated "dumb" terminals.

The client-server architecture denotes a system that hosts, delivers, and manages the majority of the resources and services requested by the client. 
All requests and services are supplied across a network under this approach, which is also known as the networking computer model or client server network. 

A client-server architecture, often known as a client-server model, is a network application that divides duties and responsibilities between clients and servers on the same system or connected via a computer network. 
Multiple users' workstations, PCs, or other devices are often connected to a central server through an Internet connection or other network. 
The client submits a data request, which the server acknowledges and accommodates by transmitting data packets.
Simply put
* The customer first transmits their request using a network-enabled device. 
* The network server then accepts and processes the user's request. 
* Finally, the server sends the response to the client.
