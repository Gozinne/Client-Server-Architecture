## Client-Server Architeure using MySQL Overview

There is a documentation of all you need to know about [Client-Server Architecture](https://github.com/Gozinne/Client-Server-Architecture)somewhere in this repository. In this section, we will concentrate on creating one using the MySQL Database Management System (DBMS).

In the preceding example, a system attempting to visit a Web site using a Web browser or simply the "curl" command is a client, and it makes HTTP requests to a Web server (Apache, Nginx, IIS, or any other) via the Internet.

If we expand this notion and include a database server in our design, we obtain the following picture:

In this example, our Web Server acts as a "client," connecting to and reading and writing to and from a Database (DB) Server (MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle, SQL Server, or any other), with communication taking place via a Local Network (it can also be an Internet connection, but it is a common practise to place the Web Server and DB Server close to each other in a local network). The setup displayed in the image above is a typical generic Web Stack architecture that you have already used in previous projects (LAMP, [LEMP](https://github.com/Gozinne/WEB-STACK-IMPLEMENTATION-LEMP-.github.io), [MEAN](https://github.com/Gozinne/WEB-STACK-IMPLEMENTATION-MEAN-.github.io), [MERN](https://github.com/Gozinne/WEB-STACK-IMPLEMENTATION-MERN-.github.io)). From simple single-page applications (SPAs) to large and complex portals, this architecture may be used with a range of other technologies, including different Web and DB servers.

An actual LAMP website example: This Github account has a [LAMP](https://github.com/Gozinne/WEB-STACK-IMPLEMENTATION-LAMP-) stack website implementation. Consider the following professionally deployed LAMP website: www.google.com. This LAMP website server(s) can be hosted anywhere in the world, and you can connect to them over the global network, the Internet. Assume you go to your browser and enter www.google.com. It denotes that your browser is the ", ient." It is essentially sending queries to the remote server and expecting a response from the distant server. Let's take a brief look at client-server communication in action. Launch the curl command in your Ubuntu or Windows terminal.
```
curl -Iv www.google.com
```
**Note**: If your Ubuntu does not have "curl," run to install it.
```
sudo apt install curl
```
In this example, your terminal is the client, and www.google.com is the server. 
The result below shows the answer from the remote server.

You can also see that the URL requests are being delivered by a machine with an IP address of 216.58.223.228 and a port number of 80. 
When it comes to networking tasks, we'll go through IP addresses and ports in further detail. 
Another easy method is to use a simple diagnostic tool like "ping," which will also report round-trip timeâ€”the time it takes for packets to go to and from the server. The ICMP protocol is used by this utility.

## Implementing a basic Client-Server using MySQL Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

### Requirements
The following items are required to begin and complete this project.

* An account logged into the AWS console.
* Launch 2 AWS EC2 instance, name one as the `MySQL-Server` and the other as `MySOL-Client`
* Run the EC2 instance on Ubuntu 20.4, set the network security to: SSH,Port:22; HTTP,Port:80; MySQL, Port 3306, and an ICMP protocol.
* Connect VScode or MobaXterm to the EC2 instance and launch a new terminal.
